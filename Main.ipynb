    "## 7. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifiers we used for performing automatic labelling of sentences are one of the simplest algorithms that we could use to solve text/sentence classification. Their simplicity and easiness to train them are the main reasons of why we decided to use and compare them. There are alternative solutions that migth be extremely helpful for solving this task, and example of that could be RNNs. Nevertheless, for instance, using this sort of approach would involve increasing the complexity and computational costs for building the classifier model. Therefore, as we are not certain that using a more a complex approach generates the optimal performance, we preferred to maintain the complexity and computational costs as simple as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the performance of presented models, it is clear that the complexity of the approach taken is not directly related to a better performance when classifying. For example, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) has a similar performance to the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). These couple of approaches are sensitive to parameter optimization. Therefore, we preferred focusing on devising an optimal feature engineering that lead to a very competitive performance using these models. However, as this is a simple version of a robust classifier, we would need to improve our model with additional parameters that could help the model to learn a better generalization of the patterns hidden within the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there were different problems in language that we needed to consider in order for solving the task easier. For instance, we dealt with two problems: 1)word frequencies and 2) data sparsity. These two things can difficult the classification task, and mainly the capture of the most relevant information within the corpus. So, we took advantage of using POS tags frequencies to solve these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "A consequent problem of using POS tags frequencies is the accuracy of the POS taggings. We are aware that any innacuracy of the POS tagger impacts directly on the performance of the classifiers. The POS tagger used is the one provided by the NLTK library. Thus, eventhough the performance of tagging is performing reasonable well, rare or infrequent words might not be tagged properly. This might be critical for our task since we are trying to label sentences from scientific articles. In this sort of documents, rare or infrequent words tend to be the most important so it's very liekly that we could be affecting the classification taskdramatically  \n",
    "\n",
    "A next step for improving the problem of POS tagging innacuracy would be either adding more freatures to the model, and then, reduce the impact of these innacuracies, or training a new tagger with tagged data related to the domain we are interesting to tag. In this case, train a new tagger with sentences tagged of scientific articles related to Biology,Psychology and Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in order to improve the performance of the current models we could include more informative features related to the structure of the corpus. For instance, we can consider building a set of the most frequent words appearing in each of the classes and add the number of words in the sentence that appear in this set of words. In addition, we could try to look for synonyms of rare words so that our model can identify easier and more accurately the correct POS tag. Finally, we could consider prefixes and suffixes as part of the feature set so that the model can distinguish unseen words properly. \n",
